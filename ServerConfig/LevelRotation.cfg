# v2.0 LEVEL ROTATION : This must be Level Id : those are different from display names !
// NOTE: this file is used for servers running in MapRotationMode=LevelList, running in order, or for servers running in MapRotationMode=LevelList_Randomized, where the below layers are rotated randomly. This setting can be found in your Server.cfg file (make sure to use a fresh one as your basis).
// NOTE: in-line comments will not work in this config until further notice. Comment lines should be in separate lines, if used.

# Space_Fallujah is using the Squad Player Controller in case OWI bork the modded layers. However due to recent update, we cannot switch in between Squad PC and GC PC. Hence it must be removed from the rotation
