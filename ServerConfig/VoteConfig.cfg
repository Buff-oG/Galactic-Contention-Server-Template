// Duration: The duration of the voting time.
// ResultPresentationDuration: The duration where players can see the results displayed, but cannot vote.
// AccessFilter: The minimum access level required in order to vote.
// TeamFilter: The teams that you must be a member of in order to vote.

// If the number of players at the end of the match is less than this number then the next voting round uses a special pool that can have seeding or skirmish layers. Defined in LayerVotingLowPlayers.cfg
