Welcome to <a>Galactic Contention</a>!
For any issues, please use !admin or ping our staff in our <a href="https://discord.gg/galacticcontention">GC Discord</a>. Enjoy the chaos of blaster bolts and orbital barrages!

<a>Server Rules</a>
- Zero tolerance for hacking/glitching/ghosting/bug exploitation.
- Apologize for team kills in ALL CHAT.
- No intentional team killing under any circumstance.
- No asset wasting or griefing.
- No vehicle or aircraft ramming.
- Squad leaders MUST have an SL kit, microphone, and preferably use English.
- DO NOT create squads and immediately give away SL (aka "squad baiting")
- Vehicles that require crewman kits must be claimed by a single, dedicated squad. The first properly named squad has priority ("HMP/LAAT" are valid while, "Air" or "heli" are not).
- No main camping; if your sole intention is to destroy enemies entering/leaving main you are camping.
- No "main baiting"
- The [GC] tag may only be utilized by Galactic Contention Staff . Refrain from using similar tags with GC while on our servers to help us avoid confusion.
- Staff Decision is final, you may always appeal warnings/bans, unless otherwise noted.

<a>Seeding Rules</a>
- AFKs are welcome during seeding.
- Fight only over the middle point until the game is live at 45 players or called "LIVE".
- FOBs on the first points for either team may not be destroyed.
- Mortars are not allowed, other emplacements are okay.
- No commander assets are allowed except LAAT/HMP STRIKES & SMOKE.
- Do not camp HABs or farm kills; it goes against the spirit of seeding
